To extract information,the name of gaussian output file should be " out.out"
If you have any other name, rename it as *out.out"
If you do not want to rename your gaussian output file than change "out.out" to "your file name" at line#8
Put the script "extract.bash" and "out.out/yourfile" in a same folder
Do ./extract.bash
When it will prompt "Enter number of mode=" supply 3N-6 value. (suppose your molecule has 10 atom, enter 54"
When it prompt "Enter number of mode/3=" sypply (3N-6)/3 value (suppose your molecule has 10 atom, enter 18"
When it prompt "Enter number of atomes=" supply number of atoms(suppose your molecule has 10 atom, enter 10"

enjoy! you will get three ".txt" files within 0.5 seconds. this is extremly fast code.
Read this very simple code if you want to extract more informations. gaussian log file has more than 100 thousends lines .
